## 4. Document Annotation

After selecting the document and the VAST annotation scheme for values, as presented in the previous section, you can start the annotation. Your screen will be similar to the one presented in Figure 9. You can use the sidebar on the right to adjust the panels in a comfortable way.

{{< img "/images/screenshots/online/annotation.png" "Figure 9: The Annotation interface for the selected annotation schema. The Document to be annotated is shown at the left side, while the annotation schema is shown on the right side." auto >}}

The selected annotation schema is shown on the right side panel. In this case it contains a set of `buttons` organised in categories.

To make an annotation follow the steps below:

* **STEP 1**: Select the part of the document you want to annotate. A text segment can be easily selected by simply pressing the mouse wheel on the first word to be included in the segment, and then by clicking the mouse wheel again on the last word to be included in the segment.

* **STEP 2**: Press on a button from the right side panel, to annotated the selected segment with the label displayed in the button. You will immediately see that the segment is highlighted with the colour associated with the pressed button (Figure 10). By clicking on the text, the corresponding button will be also highlighted. (Figure 11).

* **STEP 3**: Save (or delete) the annotation. All the annotations are saved temporarily so that they will not be lost. To save them permanently, click on the `Save Annotations` button on top right of the window (Figure 9). To delete an annotation, click on the annotated text and then on the `Delete Annotation` button on top right of the window.

{{< img "/images/screenshots/online/segment.png" "Figure 10: To annotate the `or barely` with `Reason` select the phrase and then press the button of `Reason`." auto >}}

{{< img "/images/screenshots/online/segment-button.png" "Figure 11: Pressing on the annotated segment (to select it with the mouse), the button of the associated value is also highlighted." auto >}}

The `Annotation Visualiser` tab provides information about each annotation such as the ID of the annotation, the span (start/end of the annotated segment, in character offset for the start of the document), the creator and the creation/update timestamps. You can navigate wither by pressing on the list of the right-hand side or within the text.
